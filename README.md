# Arduino UNO Rev4 WiFi BLE Client Firmware - main

This repository contains firmware for the Arduino UNO Rev4 WiFi, implementing a simple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client. The repo consists of two branches:
- The main branch subscribes to an BLE advertised counter.
- The example/BLEsnake branch extends the functionality of the main branch to implement a BLE-controlled Snake game
